Advantage
Single Responsibility Principle: Bridge method clearly follows the Single Responsibility principle as
 it decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
 
Open/Closed Principle: It does not violate the Open/Closed principle because at any time we can 
introduce the new abstractions and implementations independently form each other

Platform independent feature: Bridge Method can be easily used for implementing the platform 
independent features.

Disadvantage

Complexity: Our code might become complexive after applying Bridge method because we are introding 
new abstarction classes and interfaces.

Double Indirection: Bridge method might have slight negative impact on the preformance because the
 abstraction needs to pass messages along with the implementation for the operation to get executed.
Interfaces with only single implementation: If we have only limited interfaces, then it doesnâ€™t 
sweat a breath but if you have an exploded set of interfaces with minimal or only one implementation
 it becomes hard to manage
